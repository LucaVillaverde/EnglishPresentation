                What is an acronyms?
            </h2>
            <p>
                An acronym is a word formed by the union of parts of two or more words, or an abbreviation that is pronounced as a word and is commonly used as such. Acronyms can be formed by the initial letters of a name or a series of words. Acronyms are not written with periods between the letters or at the end of them. Some acronyms become part of the common lexicon and are written in lowercase, except for the initial when appropriate.

                    What is an acronym?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Acronyms are words formed by the initial letters of a group of words. They are used to shorten the name of an institution, an organization, a country, or an expression. Generally, only the most important terms (nouns, verbs, and adjectives) are taken, and the secondary ones (conjunctions, prepositions, etc.) are left out. The word 'Acronym (In spanish "Sigla")' comes from the Latin 'sigla', which means 'figures' or 'abbreviations'.

                <h2>
                    What is an abbreviation?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An abbreviation is a way of writing a word or group of words with only some of its letters. It is used to shorten a text or simplify writing. An abbreviation is obtained by eliminating some of the letters or syllables from the complete word or expression. An abbreviation always ends with a period. For example, 'Mr.' is the abbreviation for mister.

                <h2 id="history">History of Networking</h2>
                <p>
                    1969: ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) became the first connected computer network, marking the birth of modern network technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1970s: The development of protocols such as TCP/IP allowed communication between different networks and computer systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1980s: The introduction of technologies such as ARCNET, Token Ring, and Ethernet began to form the basis of the networks we know today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1990s: The creation of the World Wide Web and the expansion of the Internet led to massive growth in connectivity and information exchange.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2000s onwards: The evolution continued with the advent of Wi-Fi, fiber optics, and the increased use of mobile devices and cloud computing.
                </p>
                <h2 class="internet">Who invented Internet?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Internet, the brain behind the information superhighway, is an intricate set of protocols and rules that someone had to develop before we could get to the World Wide Web.
                    Computer scientists Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn are credited with inventing the Internet communication protocols we use today and the system referred to as the Internet.
                </p>
                <h2 class="internet">Who are Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn</h2>
                <h3>Bob Khan:</h3>
                <p>Robert Kahn, Also known as: Bob Kahn, Robert Elliot Kahn. (born December 23, 1938, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.) is an American electrical engineer, one of the principal architects, with Vinton Cerf, of the Internet. In 2004 both Kahn and Cerf won the A.M. Turing Award, the highest honour in computer science, for their “pioneering work on internetworking, including the design and implementation of the Internet’s basic communications protocols, TCP/IP, and for inspired leadership in networking.”

                    After receiving an engineering degree from City College of New York in 1960, Kahn received a master’s degree (1962) and a doctorate (1964) in electrical engineering from Princeton University. Immediately after completing his doctorate, Kahn worked for Bell Laboratories and subsequently served as an assistant professor of electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 1964 to 1966. However, it was his role as a senior scientist at Bolt Beranek & Newman (BB&N), an engineering consulting firm located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that brought Kahn into contact with the planning for a new kind of computer network, the ARPANET.</p>
                <h3>Vinton Cerf:</h3>
                <p>Vinton Cerf, Also known as: Vinton Gray Cerf. (born June 23, 1943, New Haven, Connecticut, U.S.) is an American computer scientist who is considered one of the founders, along with Robert Kahn, of the Internet. In 2004 both Cerf and Kahn won the A.M. Turing Award, the highest honour in computer science, for their “pioneering work on internetworking, including the design and implementation of the Internet’s basic communications protocols, TCP/IP, and for inspired leadership in networking.”

                    In 1965 Cerf received a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Stanford University in California. He then worked for IBM as a systems engineer before attending the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), where he earned a master’s degree and then a doctorate in computer science in 1970 and 1972, respectively. He then returned to Stanford, where he joined the faculty in computer science and electrical engineering.</p>
